For my project, I have made an SPA to generate a dungeon for TTRPGs, such as Dungeons & Dragons.

The program takes various inputs from the user through select boxes on the page, such as the number of rooms, and dungeon size, and will generate a realistic looking dungeon following these guides. It will then display the dungeon right there on the page, for the user to copy/save, and use immediately in their game.

The intention behind this program is for a game master to quickly use if caught in a situation they haven't been able to plan for, and need to quickly throw down a map for a battle or such. It can also be used as a base for game masters to plan their dungeon, as it offers a blank template for them to populate with whatever they need.
